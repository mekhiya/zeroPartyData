# Project ZeroPartyData

## What is Zero-party data?

Zero-party data is data that a customer intentionally and proactively shares with a brand. My project ZeroPartyData uses zk-snarks to verify is user is eligible for latest gift or offers.

## How Zero Knowledge Proof helps?

zeroPartData uses zero knowledge proof to verify eligibility for gifts & discount offers by Brands. Project requires users to submit information about their Work-type, Age & income. This is suppose to be checked against eligibility criteria for availing discount offer.

Personal data is not stored on-chain, however zero knowledge proof allows us to verify all 3 criteria. If proved, user address is noted for availing discount offer.

Using Zero Knowledge Proof Brands can confidently claim that they do not store Personal information. And yet provide discounts & offers if user's details match their eligiblity criteria.

## Project ZeroPartyData collects below information

- WorkType (Salaried or Business owner)
- Age
- Income
  (above details)

zk-SNARK based ZeroPartyData provides data protection, so when users connect to a third party, it never discloses personal data. But allows one to prove personal information .

## STACK USED:

### BACKEND FRAMEWORK :

    Hardhat + Solidity

### ZERO KNOWLEDGE PROOF :

    zk-snarks created using Circom 2.0 & snarkjs.

### FRONTEND:

    Nextjs + ether.js

### NETWORK:

    Polygon

### Decentralised Web hsoting:

    Spheron Protocol

## SPONSORS

### Polygon:

    solves common blockchain pain points, offering low gas fees and high speeds without sacrificing security.

### Spheron:

    Spheron is the simplest, fastest and most convenient way to deploy your web apps and projects onto Decentralized Cloud Storage

## CHALLENGES :

I learnt Zero Knowledge concepts. Started writing circuits using Circom 2.0 . Bringing all piece togather for creating fullstack dapp was a big challenge. snarkjs library is to be used inside hardhat & frontend to allow proof creation inside UI. Verification done by on-chain contract.

## Advantages :

- Brands can collect market new offers to their Customers.
- Customers can confidently check new offers with assurance that their personal info is not saved on-chain.
- (Work in Progress) Brands can develop a basic profile on their customers and get in touch with them when you need to.
